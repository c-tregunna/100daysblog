                <h3>Day 14</h3>
                <p>So Type Conversion and Coercion is a little confusing, especially the coercion, and tough to get head around. Definitely a point where you use <code>console.log</code> to really see what you are getting.</p>
                <p>Lets have a look at some examples. Pop these in your code and view in the console to see the outcome.</p>
                <div class="day_section_img_wrapper">

                <p>As I have said previosuly, it's a great thing to practice what you are learning, and today I had a code challenge to use the <code>if/else</code> statement.</p>
                <p>For this challenge I reused the code from the BMI challenge on day 10 and logged to the console a string if one BMI was higher than the other. Simple</p>

                <h3>Day 12</h3>
                <p>The video today went through the <code>if/else</code> statements. Simple enough to understand. Set a condition in the <code>()</code> within the <code>if</code> block and then if that condition is true, the code in the <code>{}</code> will execute. Then you can add a <code>else</code> statement, so this will execute if the <code>if</code> block is false. Make sense??</p>
                <p>You don't need to use a <code>else</code> block, this is just a great and powerful way to execute bits of code.</p>

                <p>The subject for today is strings and template literals. Can I just say now how grateful I am for the addition of template literals. They really just make life SOOOOOO much easier than the older concatination way of producing a string.</p>
                <p>For this video we created some variables to form a short sentence and then put those variables together to form a string. Below you will see the older way of doing it and the newer way, the much easier way.</p>

                <p>Today's video was a simple coding challenge. These are the best way to cement the information already learned.</p>
                <p>So for this challenge I had to use operators and variables to return a boolean value. Calculating if one persons BMI was higher than the others. Phew.....it worked.</p>
                <p>I could cut the code down a bit by using <code>console.log</code> just once, like so <code>console.log(markBMI, johnBMI, markHigherBMI);</code></p>

                <h3>Day 7</h3>
                <p>Today's video was all about JS Operators and showing the basic uses of some of them. There as just soooooo many that the video certainly did not cover them all.</p>
                <p>The basic use of operators is to combine or transform values. Infact, you use an operator when you declare a variable. <code>const firstName = "Claire";</code> the <code>=</code> is a operator</p>
                <p>I could be here all day writing what various operators do, by why bother when someone else has already done it for you. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp" target="_blank">Here is a list.</a></p>

                <p>Let('s) const(ider) var(iables)</p>
                <p>In JS there are 3 ways of declaring variables. Now you could declare a variable without one of these words, but not a good idea people! Shall we have a look at how variables can be declared? Alrighty then....</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>let</code> - This way of declaring a variable will mean you can alter the value of the variable.</li>
                    <li><code>const</code> - Super useful. These variables CAN NOT be reassigned, they are constant</li>
                    <li><code>var</code> - Similar to <code>let</code> however, with some differences, which I have not covered as yet.</li>

                <h3>Day 5</h3>
                <p>Time to cover data types. It appears this has updated since I originally started learning JS and currently (2021) there are 7 data types in JS. Let's have a look at them and what they are used for:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Number: Floating point numbers, always have a decimal point even if you do not see it - Used for decimal and integer</li>
                    <li>String: A sequence of characters, used for text. Always need to be in quotes, either ' ' or " "</li>
                    <li>Boolean: Logical type, only ever true or false. Used for making decisions</li>
                    <li>Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined</li>
                    <li>Null: Also means an empty value. Will show as an object using typeof. This is a known bug in JS</li>
                    <li>Symbol: Came along in ES2015. A value that is unique and cannot be changed. Huh??</li>
                    <li>BigInt: Came along in ES2020. Large integers that a Number type can't hold. WHAT??</li>
                </ol>
                <p>So there are a couple of new ones here to me, but sure these will be covered as I work through the course. The main thing here is you will usually use the first 3 data types in your code.</p>
                <h4>What does each data type look like?</h4>
                <div class="day_section_img_wrapper">
                    <figure>

                <div class="day_section_img_wrapper">

                        <img src="images/string_type.png" alt="image of js string type">
                        <figcaption>String data type</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                        <figcaption>Undefined data type</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>In the <code>console.log()</code> you will see <code>typeof</code>. Using this will show you in the console the data type you have defined. The great thing with JS is it will auto define a data type when stored in a variable. WHOOP!!</p>

                <h3>Day 4</h3>
                <p>No JS today, instead  helped my lovely wife with some coding for a new helpdesk system for her IT department. The acual software is quite restricting, so it required some jiggery and pokery to get the desired look.</p>
                <p>Having a break from your path you have set out on is fine. It's good to take a break and also to keep working with other languages to ensure you don't get rusty. Remember JS works hand in hand with HTML and CSS.</p>

            <section class="day_section">
                <h3>Day 3</h3>
                <p>Let's talk variables and naming conventions. It's best to be descriptive with naming variables in JS. This, I guess, is common sense. However it could be so easy to name something name or job. But what name? What job?</p>
                <p>Variables are SO important in JS, so it's vital to understand them, how to name them and how to use them. A few things to consider when naming a variable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's best to use <code>camelCase</code> when naming. Why, cause you should k.</li>
                    <li>There are reserved keywords which you can't use as these will throw and error. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp" target="_blank">Here is a list</a></li>
                    <li>There are 3 ways to declare a variable, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. &ast;&ast;</li>
                    <li>Ultimately, the variable is there to store a value</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So think of a variable like a box. The variable name is the label on the box and the value you gave to the variable is the contents of the box.</p>
                <h4>What is camelCase? Is it luggage for a camel?</h4>
                <p>Errr...no. Simply put it is a way of writing something. So if you are using more than one word, the first word starts in lowercase, in the second word, the first letter is capitilized, in the third word, the first letter is capitilized and so on. See this in action on the variable below.</p>

                <p>Today I have gone through a video about how to link a Javascript file. Pfft...I already know this, however, a refresh is always good to solidify those basics.</p>
                <p>At this point I am going to mention I am going to be working on my Javascript knowledge using <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> and also <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"target="_blank">Udemy</a>. The reason I am using 2 resources, is whilst I LOVE the structure of Treehouse, for my new period of learning I want a different perspective and the JS course I am working on in Udemy was updated within the past 12 moths so it is fully up to date. I will of course be dipping in to both, especially into Treehouse for the practices and workshops</p>

                <p>When I first started the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> Tech Degree, I would happily admit my hatred for Javascript and total disregard for wanting to learn it AND always said "Nope, it's to damn hard, sod off". I was wrong. With some time, patience, great teaching and, yes, a few tears, I have the basics covered.</p>
                <h4>So why the hell are you re-starting then? Why not move on to something new?</h4>
                <p>Good question, well presented. See above, I have the basics, and that, in my option is not enough. I want to know more, I want to acheive more. One day I will write JS code for a responsive menu, or dynamically add in content from an array of objects. I'll look back a week later and think, "How the fudge did I do that?" That, for me, is not good enough.</p>
                <p>So here I am, starting from scratch. I know I'll get distracted, I know I will want to skip things, but covering the basics, understanding them is so SO important. Wish me luck!</p>
