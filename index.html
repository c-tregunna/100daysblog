    <h1>100 Days Of Javascript Code</h1>


    <section class="day_section">
        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        <p>When I say back to basics, I mean <span class="underline">back to basics</span>.</p>
        <p>Today I have gone through a video about how to link a Javascript file. Pfft...I already know this, however, a refresh is always good to solidify those basics.</p>
        <p>At this point I am going to mention I am going to be working on my Javascript knowledge using <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> and also <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"target="_blank">Udemy</a>. The reason I am using 2 resources, is whilst I LOVE the structure of Treehouse, for my new period of learning I want a different perspective and the JS course I am working on in Udemy was updated within the past 12 moths so it is fully up to date. I will of course be dipping in to both, especially into Treehouse for the practices and workshops</p>
        <h4>Blah blah...so what have your learn't?</h4>
        <p>Check out these code snippets on the differnet ways you can include Javascript in your code</p>

                <figcaption>This attachs an external JS file, just like a CSS file. This code is best placed just before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This is the best way to include JS in your project</figcaption>

        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>Well I figure it is time to pull my socks up and admit that I need to refresh my Javascript knowledge</p>
        <p>When I first started the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> Tech Degree, I would happily admit my hatred for Javascript and total disregard for wanting to learn it AND always said "Nope, it's to damn hard, sod off". I was wrong. With some time, patience, great teaching and, yes, a few tears, I have the basics covered.</p>
        <h4>So why the hell are you re-starting then? Why not move on to something new?</h4>
        <p>Good question, well presented. See above, I have the basics, and that, in my option is not enough. I want to know more, I want to acheive more. One day I will write JS code for a responsive menu, or dynamically add in content from an array of objects. I'll look back a week later and think, "How the fudge did I do that?" That, for me, is not good enough.</p>
        <p>So here I am, starting from scratch. I know I'll get distracted, I know I will want to skip things, but covering the basics, understanding them is so SO important. Wish me luck!</p>
