    <h1>100 Days Of Javascript Code</h1>
    <section class="day_section">
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>Well I figure it is time to pull my socks up and admit that I need to refresh my Javascript knowledge</p>
        <p>When I first started the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> Tech Degree, I would happy admit my hatred for Javascript and total disregard for wanting to learn it AND always said "Nope, it's to damn hard, sod off". I was wrong. With some time, patience, great teaching and, yes, a few tears, I have the basics covered.</p>
        <p>So why the hell are you re-starting then? Why not move on to something new? Good question, well presented. See above, I have the basics, and that, in my option is not enough. I want to know more, I want to acheive more. One day I will write JS code for a responsive menu, or dynamicall add in content from and array of objects. I'll look back a week later and think, "How the fudge did I do that?" That, for me, is not good enough.</p>
        <p>So here I am, starting from scratch. I know I'll get distracted, I know I will want to skip things, but covering the basics, understanding them is so SO important. Wish me luck!</p>
