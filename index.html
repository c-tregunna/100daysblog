        <h3>Day 3</h3>
        <p>Let's talk variables and naming conventions. It's best to be descriptive with naming variables in JS. This, I guess, is common sense. However it could be so easy to name something name or job. But what name? What job?</p>
        <p>Variables are SO important in JS, so it's vital to understand them, how to name them and how to use them. A few things to consider when naming a variable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's best to use <code>camelCase</code> when naming. Why, cause you should k.</li>
            <li>There are reserved keywords which you can't use as these will throw and error. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp" target="_blank">Here is a list</a></li>
            <li>There are 3 ways to declare a variable, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. &ast;&ast;</li>
            <li>Ultimately, the variable is there to store a value</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So think of a variable like a box. The variable name is the label on the box and the value you gave to the variable is the contents of the box.</p>
        <h4>What is camelCase? Is it luggage for a camel?</h4>
        <p>Errr...no. Simply put it is a way of writing something. So if you are using more than one word, the first word starts in lowercase, in the second word, the first letter is capitilized, in the third word, the first letter is capitilized and so on. See this in action on the variable below.</p>

        </div>
        <p>&ast;&ast; I did not cover this today, this is a future lesson, this is something I learnt previously.</p>

    <section class="day_section">
        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        <p>When I say back to basics, I mean <span class="underline">back to basics</span>.</p>
        <p>Today I have gone through a video about how to link a Javascript file. Pfft...I already know this, however, a refresh is always good to solidify those basics.</p>
        <p>At this point I am going to mention I am going to be working on my Javascript knowledge using <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> and also <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"target="_blank">Udemy</a>. The reason I am using 2 resources, is whilst I LOVE the structure of Treehouse, for my new period of learning I want a different perspective and the JS course I am working on in Udemy was updated within the past 12 moths so it is fully up to date. I will of course be dipping in to both, especially into Treehouse for the practices and workshops</p>
        <h4>Blah blah...so what have your learn't?</h4>
        <p>Check out these code snippets on the differnet ways you can include Javascript in your code</p>
        <div class="day_section_img_wrapper">

                <img src="images/first_script.png" alt="image of a script tag with Javascript code - inline script">
                <figcaption>Inline script tag, this is added to the html page, either in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag or just before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/second_script.png" alt="image of a script tag with Javascript code - external script file">
                <figcaption>This attachs an external JS file, just like a CSS file. This code is best placed just before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This is the best way to include JS in your project</figcaption>

        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>Well I figure it is time to pull my socks up and admit that I need to refresh my Javascript knowledge</p>
        <p>When I first started the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> Tech Degree, I would happily admit my hatred for Javascript and total disregard for wanting to learn it AND always said "Nope, it's to damn hard, sod off". I was wrong. With some time, patience, great teaching and, yes, a few tears, I have the basics covered.</p>
        <h4>So why the hell are you re-starting then? Why not move on to something new?</h4>
        <p>Good question, well presented. See above, I have the basics, and that, in my option is not enough. I want to know more, I want to acheive more. One day I will write JS code for a responsive menu, or dynamically add in content from an array of objects. I'll look back a week later and think, "How the fudge did I do that?" That, for me, is not good enough.</p>
        <p>So here I am, starting from scratch. I know I'll get distracted, I know I will want to skip things, but covering the basics, understanding them is so SO important. Wish me luck!</p>
